If anyone knows how to set up GitHub in Eclipse, with already existing code, please submit a pull request on this
file explaining how to do it. Thanks!

My mod for Minecraft that adds decroative blocks and more!

The GitHub is still a very much work in progress as I am still getting it to work...

If you find any bugs in my code, or you want to improve anything, feel free to add a pull request with as much detail
as possible as to why you changed that, and what difference it will make!

Thanks
