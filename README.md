DecoCraft
=========

My mod for Minecraft that adds decroative blocks and more!

The GitHub is still a very much work in progress as I am still getting it to work as I would like. Over the next few days/weeks,
I will be uploading my code onto here. This is mainly here if anyone wants to correct my code, suggest ideas, see how I do things or report issues. 

If you find any bugs in my code, or you want to improve anything, feel free to add a pull request with as much detail
as possible as to why you changed that, and what difference it will make! I have not used GitHub really before, so if you submit junk pull requests
I may panic. Please bear with me, as I am still learning :P


Even though this mod is open source, please respect that it is subject to copyright, and cannot be redistributed in its source form. For full
legislation terms, please read my copyright file.


Thanks
